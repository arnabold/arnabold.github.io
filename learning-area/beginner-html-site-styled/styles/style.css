/* CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on 
your page has properties like:
- padding, the space around the content. 
- border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
- margin, the space around the outside of the border.
Three boxes sat inside one another. From outside to in they are labelled margin, border and padding

/* We center the image to make it look better. We could use the margin: 0 auto 
trick again as we did for the body. But there are differences that require an 
additional setting to make the CSS work. The <body> is a block element, meaning 
it takes up space on the page. The margin applied to a block element will be 
respected by other elements on the page. In contrast, images are inline 
elements, for the auto margin trick to work on this image, we must give it 
block-level behavior using display: block;. */

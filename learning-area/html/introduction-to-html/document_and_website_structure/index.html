  <!-- Non-semantic wrappers
  Sometimes you'll come across a situation where you can't find an ideal 
  semantic element to group some items together or wrap some content. 
  For cases like these, HTML provides the <div> and <span> elements. 
  You should use these preferably with a suitable class attribute, 
  to provide some kind of label for them so they can be easily targeted.
    
  <span> is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you 
  can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, 
  or don't want to add any specific meaning. 

  <div> is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you 
  can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add 
  any specific meaning.

    There once was a man named O'Dell<br />
    Who loved to write HTML<br />
    But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br />
    and his markup didn't read very well.

  <!-- <hr>: the thematic break element
   <hr> elements create a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a 
   thematic change in the text (such as a change in topic or scene). 
   Visually it just looks like a horizontal line. -->

    Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but
    determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do
    battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.

    Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and
    pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted
    distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it
    hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.

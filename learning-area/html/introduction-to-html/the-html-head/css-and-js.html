  <!-- The <link> element should always go inside the head of your document. 
   This takes two attributes, rel="stylesheet", which indicates that it is the 
   document's stylesheet, and href, which contains the path to the stylesheet 
   file -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

  <!-- The <script> element should also go into the head, and should include a 
    src attribute containing the path to the JavaScript you want to load, and 
    defer, which basically instructs the browser to load the JavaScript after 
    the page has finished parsing the HTML. 
    This is useful as it makes sure that the HTML is all loaded before the 
    JavaScript runs, so that you don't get errors resulting from JavaScript 
    trying to access an HTML element that doesn't exist on the page yet. -->
